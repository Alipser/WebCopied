It&#8217;s highly expressive and easy to read, and it also has a strong focus on user-interface development, which makes it well-suited for building interactive web applications. Many of the latest functional features such as immutability, stateless functions, anonymous functions, and pattern matching are incorporated into the language. But the best part is Elm\u2019s very own architecture which makes managing data flow between various components a breeze.<\/p>\n<p>Elm is a perfect choice for developers who want to build high-quality, interactive web applications with ease and efficiency, which is why companies such as Microsoft, IBM,\u00a0 NoRedInk, and Prezi use Elm for their front-end applications.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re interested in learning more, continue reading to find my top picks for the best Elm courses.

He found that <a href=\"https:\/\/seas.harvard.edu\/news\/2015\/10\/alumni-profile-evan-czaplicki-ab-12\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">web development was often difficult, error-prone, and frustrating<\/a>, and he wanted to create a language that would make it easier to build high-quality, interactive web applications. And thus, Elm was born.<\/p>\n<p>Elm is robust. It\u2019s almost impossible to have runtime errors in Elm thanks to its robust static type system, which ensures that the type of variables must be specified before it can be used (either manually or inferred). Hence, a lot of time and effort is saved when it comes to debugging and testing.<\/p>\n<p>Elm also provides a standardized, novel architecture (Model-View-Update) for organizing code, making data flow management between components easy and eliminating the need to compare and contrast multiple frameworks, allowing developers to focus on the problem at hand.<\/p>\n<p>Elm is lightweight and performant. Elm compiles to a small JavaScript file size, making it ideal for web development, especially for applications with limited resources or slow internet connections. Yet, it is even faster than most popular JavaScript frameworks\u2009\u2014\u2009even without optimizations. Just look at the following graphs!<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_85505\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-85505\" style=\"width: 740px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-85505\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/asset-sizes.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"740\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/asset-sizes.png 740w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/asset-sizes-300x203.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-85505\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">from <a href=\"https:\/\/elm-lang.org\/news\/small-assets-without-the-headache\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Small Assets without the Headache<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<figure id=\"attachment_85506\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-85506\" style=\"width: 800px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-85506\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/everyone.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/everyone.png 800w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/everyone-300x188.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/everyone-768x480.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-85506\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">from <a href=\"https:\/\/elm-lang.org\/news\/blazing-fast-html-round-two\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Blazing Fast HTML<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Elm is maintainable. Elm, as a functional language, comes with features you\u2019d expect such as immutability, stateless functions, anonymous functions, and pattern matching, that reduces the complexity of code (such as states). Elm can also easily interoperate with existing JavaScript code, so you don\u2019t have to rewrite everything in Elm (yet).<\/p>\n<p>Elm is simple. Although its syntax is inspired by the Meta Language family of languages (like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/best-free-haskell-courses\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Haskell<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/best-ocaml-courses\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OCaml<\/a>), which are known for their steep learning curve, Elm instead opts for a simpler yet expressive syntax. Hence, Elm is not only easy-to-learn, but it is also easy-to-reason.<\/p>\n<p>If Elm is so great, <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/jah2488\/elm-companies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">who is using it<\/a>?

I chose this as my top pick as it is full of bite-sized nuggets of information. You\u2019ll learn the basic syntax and semantics of Elm and gradually shift towards building interactive modern web applications, picking up the best design principles and patterns that can be applied to every programming language out there.<\/p>\n<p>You should have a basic understanding of programming to take this course, as well as a solid foundation in HTML\/CSS.<\/p>\n<h3>What You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>The course begins with a brief introduction to Elm programming where you\u2019ll install the Elm Platform and explore the various high-level tools and concepts needed to build a simple web-page, such as the Elm programming language, architecture, compiler, and runtime.<\/p>\n<p>One of the hardest things about learning a programming language is getting accustomed to its syntax. You\u2019ll learn the basic syntax as well as data structures like lists, arrays, and records which you can use complex mattern-patching code for nested logic. You\u2019ll also learn how to import third-party modules from elsewhere. Everything you\u2019ve learned so far will help you appreciate and understand how Elm\u2019s immutable values, pure functions, and a powerful type system lead to reliable and maintainable programs.<\/p>\n<p>Elm is both a programming language and an architecture. Both are needed to build robust front-end web applications. After studying the programming language, you\u2019ll study how the Elm architecture manages data flow in apps using the Model View Update pattern. By learning how to create, read, update, and delete data from a server by sending HTTP requests, you\u2019ll be able to build single-page applications that can interact with JavaScript using ports, flags, and custom elements.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>This course consists of 8 chapters in total. You\u2019ll learn by reading through the course chapters, looking at the example code, and implementing what you\u2019ve learned on your PC.<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Website<\/b><\/td>\n<td>elmprogramming.com<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Instructor<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Pawan Poudel<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Level<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Beginner<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Workload<\/b><\/td>\n<td>N\/A<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Certificate<\/b><\/td>\n<td>None<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h3>Fun Facts.<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">All code examples <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/pawanpoudel\/beginning-elm-code\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">can be found on GitHub<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Pawan Poudel is a highly experienced software developer with over fifteen years of experience in the field.

It covers less of the theoretical concepts and more on getting you started.<\/p>\n<p>You should have some experience in any programming language to take this course.<\/p>\n<h3>What You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>You\u2019ll begin this course by setting up Elm in VSCode and its necessary plugins and tools, such as the REPL, make, and init. Then, after creating the source JSON file, you\u2019ll initialize a local web development server and begin writing your first Elm application.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll go over the basic structure of an Elm application, which consists of the main function as well as the Elm architecture of Model-View-Update. The three-part architecture requires an initial value of the model, a view function to represent the model on the screen and an update method to handle the changes to the data. Next, you\u2019ll learn how to handle user input in the case of text forms or buttons, and trigger an event to send a message to the model and request an update to the model. You\u2019ll also understand how to use the Maybe type to handle the possibility of errors when parsing user input.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>This course is 1 hour long. You\u2019ll learn by watching the series of instructional videos and following along with the instructor as he demonstrates the ins-and-outs of developing an Elm application.<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Provider<\/b><\/td>\n<td>YouTube<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Instructor<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Jesse Warden<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Level<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Beginner<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Workload<\/b><\/td>\n<td>1 hour long<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Enrollments<\/b><\/td>\n<td>52K<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Certificate<\/b><\/td>\n<td>None<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h3>Fun Facts<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Jesse\u2019s channel revolves around programming and fitness\/nutrition topics from enterprise to gaming, from Sencha to simple JavaScript, from Flash &amp; Flex to Corona SDK.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">To follow up this course, take a look at his much more advanced course where he builds a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLZEZPz6HkCZkLCmyoPt1BqI_kO8BuZYYu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Temperature Converter in Elm &amp; Bulma<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in this course, you can find <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/youtube-elm-basics-122047\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">more information about the course and how to enroll here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"anchor-5\">5. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/independent-an-introduction-to-elm-122048\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">An Introduction to Elm (elm-lang.org)<\/a><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-85502\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/5.-An-Introduction-to-Elm-elm-lang.org_.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/5.-An-Introduction-to-Elm-elm-lang.org_.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/5.-An-Introduction-to-Elm-elm-lang.org_-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/5.-An-Introduction-to-Elm-elm-lang.org_-768x384.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The official guide to Elm, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/independent-an-introduction-to-elm-122048\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">An Introduction to Elm<\/a>, is a <b>free <\/b>comprehensive resource that will teach you the basics of programming in Elm, as well as fundamental principles and patterns to help you create interactive applications using the renowned Elm Architecture. By the end, you\u2019ll have a concrete understanding of the core ideas and patterns that make Elm nice to use.<\/p>\n<p>Prior experience with programming languages (JavaScript preferred) is required to take this course.<\/p>\n<h3>What You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>You\u2019ll start by immediately familiarizing yourself with the values and functions of Elm. Then, you\u2019ll quickly explore the intuitive Elm architecture by building simple buttons, text fields, and forms programs.<\/p>\n<p>Moving on, you\u2019ll learn about types and even create custom types yourself as a way to guarantee that your app will not crash during runtime. Pattern matching will prove itself handy when extracting values from types that hold data, or when handling errors by using Maybe and Result types.<\/p>\n<p>The Elm Architecture handles mouse and keyboard interactions, but what about talking to servers? You\u2019ll learn about commands and subscriptions, which are ways to handle side effects in Elm such as making HTTP requests and working with JSON data. They can also help you interoperate with JavaScript by passing data between them JavaScript.<\/p>\n<p>Next, you&#8217;ll learn web app structure and best practices of creating web apps in concepts such as in navigation, URL Parsing, and modules. Finally, you\u2019ll learn how to optimize an Elm app through techniques such as Html.lazy and Html.keyed for rendering large lists of data in Elm and minification for reducing the size of your code.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>This course is 12 hours long. You\u2019ll learn by reading through the course materials and applying what you\u2019ve learned through your own practice.<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Website<\/b><\/td>\n<td>elm-lang.org<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Level<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Beginner<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Workload<\/b><\/td>\n<td>N\/A<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Certificate<\/b><\/td>\n<td>None<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h3>Fun Facts<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Ce cours est \u00e9galement disponible <a href=\"https:\/\/guide.elm-france.fr\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">en fran\u00e7ais<\/a> (this course is also available in French).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in this course, you can find <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/independent-an-introduction-to-elm-122048\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">more information about the course and how to enroll here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"anchor-6\">6. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/exercism-elm-110591\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Elm (Exercism)<\/a><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-85503\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/6.-Elm-Exercism.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/6.-Elm-Exercism.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/6.-Elm-Exercism-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/6.-Elm-Exercism-768x384.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/exercism-elm-110591\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Exercism<\/a> is a <b>free <\/b>platform that provides a wide range of coding exercises to help developers improve their programming skills in various different languages, one of them being Elm.<\/p>\n<p>The best feature of Exercism is that they offer <b>free<\/b> personal mentoring to everyone.

You\u2019ll also also learn about extensible data and the difference between open and closed records, and practice creating your own custom types to add constraints to your code.<\/p>\n<p>Next, you\u2019ll delve into organizing and scaling Elm applications as they grow in size and complexity. You\u2019ll study another kind of type called narrowing types and how to use them to create logical boundaries, rather than relying solely on file length.<\/p>\n<p>Reusing parts of a user interface can speed up development time and help you resolve defects. Luckily, this can be done easily with helper functions. However, there are some cases where reuse isn\u2019t best practice, and you\u2019ll cover those cases in the course.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes, there can be multiple sources of truth for the same information. You\u2019ll learn how to ensure there is only one source of information in the end product, along with learning how to decode types.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, you will see how everything you have learned thus far relates to building single-page applications by examining the Conduit codebase.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>This course is 4\u20135 hours long, and consists of eight exercises and eight lessons. After each lesson, you\u2019ll do an exercise based on what you\u2019ve just learned.<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Provider<\/b><\/td>\n<td>FrontendMasters<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Instructor<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Richard Feldman<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Level<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Beginner<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Workload<\/b><\/td>\n<td>4\u20135 hours<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Certificate<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Paid<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h3>Fun Facts<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Richard currently works for Vendr, a billion dollar company with one of the biggest Elm frontend deployments in the world.
